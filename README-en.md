# e-handwriting

a simple tool to handwriting. you need only a browser to execute this files: start myNotes.html as firefox ( or explorer, or etc..)
and begin to write as on paper.

This is the first attempt and my goal is a tool that i can use as paper to quickly write (and draw) my ideas.
Usefull to have fun with e-writing is to use a pen-mouse.

For developers:
What would still have to be done: 
Buttons: a save button, a mail-button
Hardware: find a suitable pen, find a suitable surface

Try it, develop it an have a lot of fun ;)
